Working with private Git repositories in Go requires proper configuration to ensure smooth package 
imports and module management. This blog outlines the steps you need to follow to import a Go 
package from a private Git repository seamlessly.

## 1. Prepare Git Access


Before importing the package, ensure you have proper access to the private Git repository. 
Depending on your authentication method:

- **SSH Access**:
    - Set up your SSH keys.
    - Add the public key to your Git hosting provider (e.g., **GitHub**, **GitLab**).
    - Verify access using:
    ```sh
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

- **HTTPS Access**:
    - Generate a personal access token (**PAT**) from your Git hosting provider.
    - Use a credential helper to manage HTTPS authentication.
    ```sh
    git config --global credential.helper store
    ```

## 2. Set Up the `GOPRIVATE` Environment Variable
Go uses a proxy server to fetch public modules by default. For private repositories, 
you need to tell Go to bypass the proxy by configuring the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable.

**Example for a Single Domain**:

```sh
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/your-org
```

**Example for Multiple Domains**:

```sh
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/your-org,gitlab.com/your-org
```

Add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to make it permanent.


## 3. Authenticate Git with Go

Authentication is essential for Go to fetch private modules:

- **For SSH**: Ensure your SSH keys are set up correctly and you can clone the repository manually using:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git
```
- **For HTTPS**: Use your username and PAT when prompted, or set up a credential helper:
```sh
git config --global credential.helper store
```

## 4. Import the Package in Your Code

To use the private package in your project, import it using the module path defined in the repository’s `go.mod` file. For example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/your-org/your-repo/package"
)

func main() {
    package.SomeFunction()
}
```

## 5. Fetch the Package

Run the following command to fetch the package and add it to your project:
```sh
go get github.com/your-org/your-repo/package
```
This command downloads the module and updates your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

## 6. Validate the Dependency

After fetching the package, verify that it is correctly listed in your `go.mod` file:

```sh
require github.com/your-org/your-repo v1.2.3
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, use these tips to debug:

- **Check Configuration**: Ensure the `GOPRIVATE` variable is set correctly and includes the domain of your private repository.

- **Verify Git Authentication**: Confirm that you can manually clone the repository using your preferred authentication method.

- **Enable Verbose Logging**: Add verbose flags to the go get command to inspect errors:

```sh
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" go get -v github.com/your-org/your-repo/package
```

## 8. Clean Up

After successfully importing the package, clean up your `go.mod` file to remove any unused dependencies:
```sh
go mod tidy
```
This command ensures your module file stays clean and up-to-date.

## Conclusion

By configuring the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable and setting up Git authentication, 
you can seamlessly import and use Go packages from private repositories. These steps ensure 
a secure and efficient workflow for managing private dependencies in your Go projects.

Now you’re ready to integrate private modules into your Go applications with ease!
