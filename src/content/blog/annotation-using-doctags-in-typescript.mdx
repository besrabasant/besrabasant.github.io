When working on a growing TypeScript codebase, keeping track of when a function or feature 
was introduced, or deprecated, is essential for maintainability. Proper documentation not 
only helps developers understand your code but also aids in ensuring smooth upgrades and deprecations. 
One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by using JSDoc annotations with appropriate tags. 
This blog will guide you through how to annotate your TypeScript code to track versions for functions and features effectively.

## Why Use Doc Tags for Version Tracking?


When managing software with evolving versions, you might need to:

- Indicate the version in which a function or feature was introduced (**@since**).
- Mark features as deprecated and suggest alternatives (**@deprecated**).
- Provide clear documentation that is readable by both humans and tools like IDEs and documentation generators.

Using doc tags ensures consistency and clarity, making your code self-explanatory and easy to navigate.

## JSDoc Basics

JSDoc is a widely used tool for documenting JavaScript and TypeScript code. 
By adding special annotations (tags) as comments, developers can provide metadata about functions, classes, and modules.

Let’s explore how you can leverage these tags in TypeScript.

### Annotating Functions with JSDoc Tags

Here’s an example of how to annotate a function using **@since** and **@deprecated** tags:


```typescript
/**
 * Computes the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param a - The first number.
 * @param b - The second number.
 * @returns The sum of `a` and `b`.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @deprecated Since 2.0.0. Use `addNumbers` instead.
 */
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **@since**: Indicates the version in which the function was introduced. This helps developers know when the feature became available.
- **@deprecated**: Marks the function as deprecated, specifying the version and providing an alternative (addNumbers). 
Most IDEs will display warnings when deprecated functions are used.

### Annotating Features in Classes

For more complex cases, such as features in a class, you can annotate methods and properties similarly. Here’s an example:

```typescript
class Calculator {
  /**
   * Multiplies two numbers.
   *
   * @param a - The first number.
   * @param b - The second number.
   * @returns The product of `a` and `b`.
   *
   * @since 1.2.0
   */
  multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a * b;
  }

  /**
   * Divides two numbers.
   *
   * @param a - The numerator.
   * @param b - The denominator.
   * @returns The result of `a / b`.
   *
   * @since 1.0.0
   * @deprecated Since 1.5.0. Use `safeDivide` for better error handling.
   */
  divide(a: number, b: number): number {
    if (b === 0) {
      throw new Error("Division by zero");
    }
    return a / b;
  }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- Document each method with its respective version using **@since**.
- When deprecating a method, provide an explanation and suggest alternatives to help developers transition smoothly.

### Supporting IDEs and Tools

1. **TypeScript-aware IDEs**:
    - Most modern IDEs (like VSCode) highlight **@deprecated** functions with warnings.
    - Hovering over a function displays metadata, such as **@since** and **@deprecated** tags, in tooltips.

2. **Documentation Generators**:
    - Tools like TypeDoc can generate comprehensive documentation, including version tags.
    - These tools format @since and @deprecated tags for easy readability in generated outputs.

### Additional Tags for Enhanced Documentation

Here are some other JSDoc tags you might find useful:

- **@example**: Provide usage examples for the function or method.
```typescript
/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 *
 * @example
 * addNumbers(2, 3); // 5
 */
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

- **@see**: Link to related functions or documentation.
```typescript
/**
 * Divides two numbers.
 *
 * @see {@link safeDivide}
 */
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a / b;
}
```
## Best Practices for Using JSDoc Tags

1. Be Consistent: Ensure that every new function or feature includes **@since** tags.
2. Provide Alternatives: For deprecated features, always suggest a replacement to guide users.
3. Follow Semantic Versioning: Use a standard versioning format like 1.0.0 for clarity.
4. Test with Documentation Generators: Validate your annotations with tools like TypeDoc to ensure they’re rendered correctly.

## Conclusion

Annotating functions and features with version-related doc tags in TypeScript is a simple but 
powerful way to maintain a clear and consistent codebase. By leveraging tags 
like **@since** and **@deprecated**, you can improve collaboration, streamline upgrades, and 
ensure that your code remains future-proof. Start documenting your functions today and watch your team’s productivity soar!
