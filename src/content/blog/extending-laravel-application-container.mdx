It's seldom that we need to extend Laravel's core, and even when we do, it's most likely we're going to extend specific components, which is [detailed in the docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/container#extending-bindings).

However, all of these instructions presume you're using the core Laravel Application ([IOC Container](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/container#introduction)) to extend the other classes. What if you want to extend the Application itself?

So, let's do it. Let's take a Laravel 5 application, extend its Application, and change its `/storage` path to be `/localstorage`.

## Extend it

First, create an application class somewhere in your namespace, and have it extend `Illuminate\Foundation\Application`. For example:

```php
<?php namespace MyLaravelApp;

class Application extends \Illuminate\Foundation\Application
{
}
```

## Register it

Now, let's find where `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` is bound. Thankfully, it's simple: `bootstrap/app.php`. The first non-comment code in the file is:

```php
$app = new Illuminate\Foundation\Application(
    realpath(__DIR__.'/../')
);
```

I think you can guess what's coming next. Just replace those lines with these:

```php
$app = new MyLaravelApp\Application(
    realpath(__DIR__.'/../')
);
```

That's it. We're now using our custom *Application* everywhere through the site.

## Override (extend) your methods

So, if our goal is to override the functionality in Application that provides the location for the `storage` directory, the final step is to find that functionality and override it.

Thankfully again, a quick glance through the `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` class makes that very clear: there's a method named `storagePath`:

```php
/**
 * Get the path to the storage directory.
 *
 * @return string
 */
 public function storagePath()
 {
     return $this->basePath.'/storage';
 }
```

â€¦ so, let's do our business. In our custom Application, let's override that method:

```php
<?php 

namespace MyLaravelApp;

class Application extends \Illuminate\Foundation\Application
{
    /**
     * Get the path to the storage directory.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function storagePath()
    {
        return $this->basePath.'/localstorage';
    }
}
```

and done. We've now just customized this path. And, *of course*, we can use this same set of steps to extend anything else that the Application class provides to Laravel.

## Conclusion

That's it! I hope this gives you the freedom and power to take more control of your Laravel-based web sites, and also the encouragement to go look around the core even more to learn how everything works.

Happy Coding!
