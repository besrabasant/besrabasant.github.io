<a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is an online, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open-source</a>
 tool used for creating websites. By open-source, I mean, the tool is free to use, free to modify and free to share. Basically, 
it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">Content Management System (CMS)</a>
built using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database. 
Initially WordPress came out as a tool for creating blogging websites but its extensive use and popularity has evolved it to much more than that. 
Today it is used for creating not only blogging websites but information websites, commercial websites, networking websites, etc.

Using WordPress is very easy and fun. All of the contents in a WordPress website is managed 
through an admin panel, that is called as **Dashboard**, built into WordPress itself. 
WordPress has a large support of themes and plugins. Themes in wordpress are design templates that are used to set the overall look of the website. 
Plugins are mostly used to provide extra functionality and advanced features, as per requirement, 
in your website that are basically not provided by WordPress. Both Themes and Plugins are managed through the Dashboard in WordPress.

<a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">wordpress.org</a> is a website which serves as a repository of themes and plugins for **WordPress**. 
The theme repository in <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">wordpress.org</a> is categorised into free and premium section. 
The free themes are avalaible _free of cost_ but premium themes can only be used after _purchase_.  
It also serves as an online manual called the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">codex</a> for WordPress and has a large supporting community of 
WordPress developers that can help you if you are stuck with something in WordPress. The users can also create their own themes and plugins, 
if they have the knowledge to do so, and share those through <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">wordpress.org</a>.
